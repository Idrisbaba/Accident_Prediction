# Accident_Prediction 

Introduction.
Recent studies predict that by 2030, traffic accidents will be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide (Venkat et al., 2020). More than 150,000 people lose their lives annually due to road traffic accidents, which have occurred to 400 crashes a day (Rana et al., 2019). This may be attributed to several factors, including mental health, financial situations, weather conditions, and road design. With the advent of self-driving or autonomous vehicles, it is likely that crashes might become more prevalent in the near future. Therefore, I believe that researching and predictions of road accidents could be one solution to addressing this pressing issue..
